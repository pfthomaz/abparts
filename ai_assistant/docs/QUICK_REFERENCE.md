"The HP gauge is showing 45 PSI instead of the normal 60 PSI. The machine is running but the cleaning cycle takes longer than usual. We replaced the pump filter last week."

"There's a loud grinding noise coming from the pump area during the cleaning cycle. It starts about 5 minutes into the cycle and continues until the cycle ends. The machine is still cleaning nets but the noise is concerning."
