## HP Gauge Issues

### When HP Gauge is in the Red Zone

**Problem**: HP gauge shows red indication
**Cause**: High pressure in the system, typically due to:
1. Clogged nozzles or spray tips
2. Blocked filters
3. Pump wear or malfunction
4. Incorrect chemical mixture

**Solution Steps**:
1. **Immediate Action**: Stop the machine immediately to prevent damage
2. **Check Nozzles**: Remove and clean all spray nozzles and tips
3. **Inspect Filters**: Check and clean/replace water and chemical filters
4. **Verify Chemical Mix**: Ensure proper dilution ratios (typically 1:10 for standard cleaning)
5. **Pump Inspection**: Check pump seals and valves for wear
6. **Pressure Relief**: Use pressure relief valve to reduce system pressure
7. **Restart Procedure**: Restart machine and monitor HP gauge

**Prevention**:
- Regular nozzle cleaning (daily)
- Filter replacement every 100 operating hours
- Proper chemical mixing procedures
- Regular pump maintenance
