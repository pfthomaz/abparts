# Machine API Schema Fix Summary

## Problem Identified
The machine API endpoints were returning 500 Internal Server Error because the Machine model in SQLAlchemy referenced several tables that didn't exist in the database:

### Missing Tables:
1. `machine_maintenance` - Referenced by Machine.maintenance_records relationship
2. `maintenance_part_usage` - Referenced by MachineMaintenance.parts_used relationship  
3. `machine_part_compatibility` - Referenced by Machine.compatible_parts relationship
4. `machine_predictions` - Referenced by Machine.predictions relationship
5. `maintenance_recommendations` - Referenced by Machine.maintenance_recommendations relationship
6. `predictive_maintenance_models` - Referenced by MachinePrediction.predictive_model relationship

### Missing Enum Types:
1. `maintenancetype` - Used by machine_maintenance.maintenance_type column
2. `maintenancerisklevel` - Used by machine_predictions.risk_level column
3. `maintenancepriority` - Used by maintenance_recommendations.priority column
4. `maintenancestatus` - Used by maintenance_recommendations.status column

## Solution Applied
Created and executed SQL script that:

### 1. Created Missing Enum Types:
- `maintenancetype`: scheduled, unscheduled, repair, inspection, cleaning, calibration, other
- `maintenancerisklevel`: low, medium, high, critical  
- `maintenancepriority`: low, medium, high, urgent
- `maintenancestatus`: pending, scheduled, in_progress, completed, cancelled

### 2. Created Missing Tables:
- `predictive_maintenance_models`: Stores ML models for predictive maintenance
- `machine_maintenance`: Records maintenance activities on machines
- `maintenance_part_usage`: Records parts used during maintenance
- `machine_part_compatibility`: Records which parts work with which machines
- `machine_predictions`: Stores ML model predictions for machines
- `maintenance_recommendations`: Stores maintenance recommendations

### 3. Added Proper Indexes:
- Performance indexes on foreign keys and frequently queried columns
- Unique constraints where appropriate (e.g., machine_id + part_id in compatibility table)

### 4. Added Foreign Key Constraints:
- All tables properly reference existing tables (machines, users, parts, warehouses)
- Maintains referential integrity

## Database Schema Status
✅ **machines table**: Already existed with all required columns and proper enum types
✅ **machinestatus enum**: Already existed with correct values (active, inactive, maintenance, decommissioned)
✅ **All missing tables**: Now created and ready for use
✅ **All missing enum types**: Now created with correct values
✅ **Foreign key relationships**: All properly established
✅ **Indexes**: Performance indexes added for optimal query performance

## Expected Result
- Machine API endpoints should now work without 500 errors
- Basic machine CRUD operations (get, create, update, delete) should function properly
- Advanced machine features (maintenance tracking, part compatibility, predictions) are now supported by the database schema
- All SQLAlchemy model relationships should resolve correctly

## Next Steps
The database schema is now consistent with the SQLAlchemy models. The next task should focus on:
1. Testing the machine endpoints to ensure they work
2. Fixing any remaining enum handling issues in the SQLAlchemy model definitions
3. Adding proper error handling to the CRUD operations
