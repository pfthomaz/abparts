## Frontend Code Tests

### 1. Component Structure Tests
- ✅ CustomerOrderForm.js: Contains complete Order Items section
- ✅ SupplierOrderForm.js: Contains identical Order Items functionality
- ✅ Both forms have:
  - Part selection dropdown with "Name (Part Number)" format
  - Quantity input with dynamic step (0.001 for bulk materials, 1 for discrete parts)
  - Unit price input (optional)
  - Add Item button
  - Items list with remove functionality
  - Validation requiring at least one item

### 2. Orders Page Integration Tests
- ✅ Orders.js properly handles form submissions
- ✅ handleCreateCustomerOrder creates order then iterates through items
- ✅ handleCreateSupplierOrder creates order then iterates through items
- ✅ Both functions use correct service methods:
  - `ordersService.createCustomerOrder()`
  - `ordersService.createCustomerOrderItem()`
  - `ordersService.createSupplierOrder()`
  - `ordersService.createSupplierOrderItem()`

### 3. Service Layer Tests
- ✅ ordersService.js contains all required functions
- ✅ Correct API endpoints: `/customer_orders`, `/supplier_orders`, `/customer_order_items`, `/supplier_order_items`
- ✅ Service functions properly exported and available

### 4. Build and Runtime Tests
- ✅ Frontend compiles successfully with no errors
- ✅ Only minor linting warnings (unused variables)
- ✅ All Docker services running correctly
- ✅ Frontend accessible at http://localhost:3000
- ✅ API accessible at http://localhost:8000

## Functional Features Verified

### ✅ Part Selection
- Dropdown shows parts in "Name (Part Number)" format
- Correctly filters and displays all 508 parts
- Part selection updates quantity step and unit display

### ✅ Quantity Handling
- Discrete parts (consumable): Step = 1, Unit = pieces
- Bulk materials: Step = 0.001, Unit = meters/liters/kg
- Real-time unit of measure display

### ✅ Item Management
- Add items to order with validation
- Display added items with part details
- Remove items functionality
- Prevent submission without items

### ✅ Order Creation Workflow
1. User fills order details (organizations, dates, etc.)
2. User adds items (part + quantity + optional price)
3. Form validates at least one item exists
4. Order created first, then items created individually
5. Page refreshes to show new order

### ✅ Data Integrity
- Orders properly linked to organizations
- Items properly linked to orders and parts
- Quantities stored as decimals (supporting bulk materials)
- Prices stored as decimals with proper precision

## Test Data Created

### Customer Order
- **Order**: 280c22e6-5ead-4e8e-8afd-31e2b556c596
- **Items**: 
  - Engine Air Filter: 2 pieces @ $25.50
  - Central Control Unit: 1 piece @ $150.00

### Supplier Order  
- **Order**: 0c603799-6eba-4de3-b2b4-218f85c60938
- **Items**:
  - Drive Belt: 5.5 meters @ $12.75

## Conclusion

The enhanced order forms are working perfectly! Both Customer Order and Supplier Order forms now have complete part selection functionality that allows users to:

1. **Select parts** from a comprehensive dropdown
2. **Add multiple items** to each order
3. **Handle different part types** (discrete vs bulk materials)
4. **Set quantities and prices** appropriately
5. **Create complete orders** with all necessary items

The implementation successfully addresses the original problem where orders were being created without items, making them incomplete and unusable.
