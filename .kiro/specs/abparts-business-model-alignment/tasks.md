## Implementation Notes

### Critical Dependencies and Risk Analysis

#### ⚠️ BLOCKING Dependencies (Must Complete in Order)
1. **Task 1 (Database Schema)** → BLOCKS ALL other backend tasks
2. **Task 2.1 (Organization Model)** → BLOCKS Tasks 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8
3. **Task 3.1 (User Model)** → BLOCKS Tasks 3.2-3.6, and ALL frontend tasks
4. **Task 3.6 (Permission System)** → BLOCKS ALL other backend endpoints
5. **Tasks 2-8 (All Backend APIs)** → BLOCKS corresponding frontend tasks (9-12)

#### 🔄 Parallel Development Opportunities
- **Tasks 2.2, 4.1, 5.1** can be developed in parallel after Task 2.1
- **Tasks 3.2-3.5** can be developed in parallel after Task 3.1
- **Frontend tasks 9.1, 10.1, 11.1** can be developed in parallel after backend APIs
- **Documentation (Task 14)** can be developed throughout the process

#### ⚡ High-Risk Refactoring Points
1. **Database Schema Changes (Task 1)** - BREAKING CHANGE, requires full system downtime
2. **User Authentication System (Task 3.1, 3.6)** - Affects ALL endpoints
3. **Inventory Model Changes (Task 4.2)** - Core business logic change
4. **Permission Enforcement (Task 3.6)** - Security-critical, affects all operations

#### 🎯 Optimized Implementation Sequence
**Phase A (Foundation - SEQUENTIAL):**
- Task 1 → Task 2.1 → Task 3.1 → Task 3.6

**Phase B (Core Backend - PARALLEL after Phase A):**
- Tasks 2.2, 4.1, 5.1 (can run in parallel)
- Tasks 3.2, 3.3, 3.4, 3.5 (can run in parallel)

**Phase C (Advanced Backend - PARALLEL after Phase B):**
- Tasks 4.2, 5.2, 6.1, 7.1 (can run in parallel)

**Phase D (Business Logic - SEQUENTIAL after Phase C):**
- Task 6.2 → Task 7.2 → Task 8.1 → Task 8.2

**Phase E (Frontend - PARALLEL after corresponding backend):**
- Tasks 9, 10, 11, 12 (can run in parallel once APIs are ready)

**Phase F (Integration - SEQUENTIAL):**
- Task 13.1 → Task 13.2 → Task 14

### Risk Mitigation
- Implement feature flags for gradual rollout of new functionality
- Maintain backward compatibility during transition period
- Create comprehensive backup and rollback procedures
- Plan for extended testing period with business stakeholders

### Success Criteria
- All existing functionality preserved during migration
- New business rules properly enforced
- User roles and permissions working as designed
- Transaction tracking providing complete audit trail
- Performance maintained or improved with new data model

This implementation plan ensures systematic delivery of the business model alignment while maintaining system stability and user experience.
