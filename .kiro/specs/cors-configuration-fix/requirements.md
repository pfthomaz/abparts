# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The ABParts application is experiencing CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) policy errors when the frontend attempts to access backend API endpoints. The error shows that requests from `http://localhost:3000` to `http://192.168.1.67:8000` are being blocked because the backend's CORS configuration is not properly set up to handle the actual request origins. This is preventing proper communication between the frontend and backend services, resulting in failed API requests and broken functionality in the dashboard.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to properly configure CORS in the FastAPI backend, so that the frontend application can successfully make API requests to the backend regardless of the deployment configuration.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the frontend makes a request from `http://localhost:3000` to the backend THEN the system SHALL include proper CORS headers allowing the request.
2. WHEN the frontend makes a request from any configured development origin THEN the system SHALL respond with appropriate CORS headers.
3. WHEN a preflight OPTIONS request is made THEN the system SHALL respond with the correct CORS headers.
4. WHEN the system is configured with environment variables for allowed origins THEN the system SHALL use those origins in the CORS configuration.
5. WHEN no environment variables are provided THEN the system SHALL fall back to sensible development defaults.
6. WHEN the backend receives a request from an unauthorized origin THEN the system SHALL reject the request appropriately.

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user of the ABParts application, I want to access dashboard data without encountering CORS errors, so that I can view important metrics and information.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user accesses the dashboard page THEN the system SHALL successfully load data from the `/dashboard/low-stock-by-org` endpoint.
2. WHEN the frontend makes requests to the `/dashboard/metrics` endpoint THEN the system SHALL return data without CORS errors.
3. WHEN the frontend makes requests to any backend API endpoint THEN the system SHALL handle the request without CORS policy violations.
4. WHEN the dashboard loads THEN all API calls SHALL complete successfully without network errors.

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want to have a flexible and secure CORS configuration, so that the application can work in different environments while maintaining security.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN configuring CORS for development THEN the system SHALL allow localhost origins on common development ports.
2. WHEN configuring CORS for production THEN the system SHALL only allow explicitly configured production origins.
3. WHEN the system processes CORS requests THEN the system SHALL specify appropriate allowed methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, OPTIONS).
4. WHEN the system processes CORS requests THEN the system SHALL specify appropriate allowed headers including Authorization and Content-Type.
5. WHEN credentials are needed for authentication THEN the system SHALL properly configure allow_credentials for cross-origin requests.
6. WHEN environment-based configuration is used THEN the system SHALL support comma-separated lists of allowed origins.
