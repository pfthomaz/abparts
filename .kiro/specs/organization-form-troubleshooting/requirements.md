# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The organization creation and editing functionality in the ABParts application is currently not working properly despite previous fixes. Users are unable to add or edit organizations through the frontend interface. This issue needs to be diagnosed and resolved to restore full organization management capabilities. The problem could be related to API connectivity, CORS configuration, authentication, or other integration issues between the frontend and backend.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a super admin, I want to successfully create new organizations through the web interface, so that I can manage the organization hierarchy effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I click "Add Organization" THEN the system SHALL display a functional organization creation form
2. WHEN I fill out the form with valid data THEN the system SHALL successfully create the organization
3. WHEN the organization is created THEN the system SHALL display a success message and refresh the organization list
4. WHEN there are validation errors THEN the system SHALL display clear error messages

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a super admin, I want to successfully edit existing organizations through the web interface, so that I can update organization information as needed.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I click "Edit" on an organization THEN the system SHALL display a pre-populated organization edit form
2. WHEN I modify the form data and submit THEN the system SHALL successfully update the organization
3. WHEN the organization is updated THEN the system SHALL display a success message and refresh the organization list
4. WHEN there are validation errors THEN the system SHALL display clear error messages

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to ensure the frontend can successfully communicate with the backend API, so that all organization operations work correctly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the frontend makes API calls THEN the system SHALL successfully connect to the backend
2. WHEN API calls are made THEN the system SHALL handle CORS properly
3. WHEN authentication is required THEN the system SHALL properly include authentication tokens
4. WHEN API errors occur THEN the system SHALL handle them gracefully and display meaningful error messages

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to verify that all organization-related API endpoints are working correctly, so that the frontend integration functions properly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN testing the organization endpoints THEN the system SHALL respond correctly to all CRUD operations
2. WHEN testing the potential parents endpoint THEN the system SHALL return appropriate parent organizations
3. WHEN testing the validation endpoint THEN the system SHALL properly validate organization data
4. WHEN testing with different user roles THEN the system SHALL enforce proper permissions
