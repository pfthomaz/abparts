# Requirements Document: Navigation Improvements

## Introduction

The ABParts application navigation system requires improvements to ensure all menu categories are properly populated and provide intuitive access to system features. Currently, the Core tab in the top menu is empty, which creates confusion for users. This document outlines the requirements for enhancing the navigation system to ensure all menu categories are properly populated and provide a consistent user experience.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Core Navigation Menu Population

**User Story:** As a user, I want the Core tab in the top menu to be populated with relevant navigation items, so that I can easily access core system features.

#### Acceptance Criteria
1. WHEN viewing the top navigation menu THEN the system SHALL display appropriate items in the Core dropdown based on user permissions
2. WHEN viewing the Core dropdown THEN the system SHALL include links to Parts Catalog, Inventory Management, Warehouses, and Orders for users with appropriate permissions
3. WHEN a user lacks permission for a specific Core menu item THEN the system SHALL hide that item from the dropdown
4. WHEN viewing the Core dropdown THEN the system SHALL organize items in a logical order based on frequency of use
5. WHEN clicking on Core menu items THEN the system SHALL navigate to the corresponding pages

### Requirement 2: Navigation Menu Consistency

**User Story:** As a user, I want consistent navigation menus across the application, so that I can easily find and access features.

#### Acceptance Criteria
1. WHEN viewing any navigation dropdown THEN the system SHALL display a consistent style and behavior
2. WHEN navigation items are categorized THEN the system SHALL ensure each category contains appropriate items
3. WHEN the navigation structure changes THEN the system SHALL maintain consistency between desktop and mobile views
4. WHEN viewing navigation menus THEN the system SHALL provide visual indicators for the current active page
5. WHEN hovering over navigation items THEN the system SHALL provide appropriate visual feedback

### Requirement 3: Permission-Based Navigation Visibility

**User Story:** As a user, I want to see only navigation items relevant to my permissions, so that I'm not confused by inaccessible features.

#### Acceptance Criteria
1. WHEN a user logs in THEN the system SHALL dynamically generate navigation menus based on their permissions
2. WHEN a user's permissions change THEN the system SHALL update navigation visibility accordingly
3. WHEN viewing navigation menus THEN the system SHALL hide categories that contain no accessible items
4. WHEN a user has limited permissions THEN the system SHALL still provide a coherent navigation experience
5. WHEN determining navigation visibility THEN the system SHALL respect both role-based and explicit permissions
