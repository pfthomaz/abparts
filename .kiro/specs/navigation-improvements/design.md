# Design Document: Navigation Improvements

## Overview

This design document outlines the approach for improving the ABParts application navigation system, with a specific focus on populating the empty Core tab in the top menu. The design ensures that navigation elements are consistently displayed based on user permissions and provides a coherent user experience across the application.

## Architecture

The navigation system in ABParts follows a permission-based approach where menu items are dynamically generated based on the user's role and specific permissions. The current architecture includes:

1. **Layout Component**: The main container that renders the navigation bar and content area
2. **Permission Utilities**: Functions that determine what navigation items should be visible to a user
3. **Navigation Categories**: Logical grouping of features (Core, Inventory, Operations, Administration)

The navigation improvements will maintain this architecture while ensuring all categories are properly populated.

## Components and Interfaces

### Navigation Generation

The navigation items are currently generated in the `getNavigationItems` function in `permissions.js`. This function returns an array of navigation items based on user permissions. The issue with the Core tab is that while the category is defined in the UI configuration, no items are explicitly assigned to this category.

We will modify the category assignment in the `getNavigationItems` function to ensure core features are properly categorized:

```javascript
// Current categorization
{
  path: '/parts',
  label: 'Parts',
  icon: 'parts',
  permission: PERMISSIONS.VIEW_PARTS,
  description: 'Browse and manage parts catalog',
  category: 'inventory', // Currently assigned to 'inventory'
  accessScope: isSuperAdmin(user) ? 'global' : 'organization'
}
```

The key features that should be moved to the 'core' category are:
- Parts Catalog
- Inventory Management
- Warehouses
- Orders

### Layout Component

The Layout component renders the navigation based on categories. The current implementation in `Layout.js` correctly handles the rendering of navigation items by category, but the Core category doesn't have any items assigned to it.

No changes are needed to the Layout component's rendering logic, as it already supports displaying items by category.

## Data Models

No changes to data models are required for this enhancement. The navigation system operates on the existing user and permission models.

## Error Handling

The navigation system already includes proper error handling for cases where:
- A user doesn't have permissions for certain features
- Categories don't have any items assigned to them

No additional error handling is required for this enhancement.

## Testing Strategy

1. **Unit Testing**:
   - Test the updated `getNavigationItems` function to ensure it correctly categorizes items
   - Verify that the Core category contains the expected items

2. **Integration Testing**:
   - Test the navigation rendering with different user roles to ensure proper visibility
   - Verify that the Core dropdown displays correctly with the assigned items

3. **User Acceptance Testing**:
   - Verify that users can navigate to all expected features from the Core dropdown
   - Ensure the navigation experience is intuitive and consistent

## Implementation Approach

The implementation will focus on modifying the category assignments in the `getNavigationItems` function in `permissions.js`. This approach minimizes changes to the codebase while ensuring the Core tab is properly populated.

No changes to the database or API are required for this enhancement, as it's purely a frontend modification.
