# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature enables access to the ABParts application from mobile devices in addition to laptop/desktop computers. The system currently runs in Docker containers with services bound to localhost, which restricts access to only the host machine. This enhancement will configure the Docker services to accept connections from other devices on the same local network, specifically mobile devices.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user, I want to access the ABParts frontend application from my mobile device, so that I can manage inventory and orders while away from my laptop.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user navigates to the frontend URL from a mobile device on the same network THEN the React application SHALL load and display correctly
2. WHEN a user interacts with the mobile interface THEN all functionality SHALL work identically to the desktop version
3. WHEN a user logs in from mobile THEN authentication SHALL work seamlessly with the backend API

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to access the backend API documentation from my mobile device, so that I can test endpoints and review API specifications while mobile.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a developer navigates to the API documentation URL from a mobile device THEN the FastAPI docs SHALL load and display correctly
2. WHEN a developer tests API endpoints from mobile THEN all endpoints SHALL respond correctly
3. WHEN API calls are made from the mobile frontend THEN CORS SHALL be properly configured to allow cross-origin requests

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the Docker services to be accessible from multiple devices on the local network, so that the application can be used flexibly across different devices.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN Docker services are started THEN they SHALL bind to all network interfaces (0.0.0.0) instead of just localhost
2. WHEN the host machine's IP address changes THEN the configuration SHALL be easily updatable
3. WHEN services are accessed from external devices THEN proper CORS headers SHALL be included in API responses

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want to maintain the ability to access the application from my laptop using localhost, so that existing workflows are not disrupted.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN accessing the application from the host machine THEN both localhost and network IP addresses SHALL work
2. WHEN switching between laptop and mobile access THEN user sessions SHALL remain consistent
3. WHEN using either access method THEN all application features SHALL function identically
