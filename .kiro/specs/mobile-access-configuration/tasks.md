# Implementation Plan

- [x] 1. Create network IP detection utility







  - Write a bash script to automatically detect the host machine's IP address using cross-platform commands
  - Create a configuration helper script that can be run before starting services
  - _Requirements: 3.2_

- [ ] 2. Update Docker Compose port bindings for network access
  - Modify port bindings in docker-compose.yml to use 0.0.0.0 instead of default localhost binding
  - Update all service port configurations (api, web, pgadmin)
  - _Requirements: 3.1_

- [ ] 3. Configure dynamic CORS origins in backend
  - Update CORS_ALLOWED_ORIGINS environment variable to include host IP addresses
  - Modify docker-compose.yml to use detected IP address in CORS configuration
  - _Requirements: 2.3, 3.1_

- [ ] 4. Update frontend API base URL configuration
  - Modify REACT_APP_API_BASE_URL environment variable to use host IP instead of localhost
  - Update docker-compose.yml web service environment configuration
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.3_

- [ ] 5. Create configuration validation script
  - Write a script to test network connectivity from external devices
  - Create automated checks for CORS configuration
  - Implement service health checks for mobile access
  - _Requirements: 2.2, 3.1_

- [ ] 6. Update documentation with mobile access instructions
  - Create setup instructions for mobile access configuration
  - Document troubleshooting steps for common network issues
  - Add firewall configuration guidance for the host operating system
  - _Requirements: 3.2_

- [ ] 7. Test mobile access functionality
  - Write automated tests to verify services are accessible from network IP
  - Create integration tests for mobile authentication flow
  - Implement tests for CORS functionality from external origins
  - _Requirements: 1.2, 2.1, 4.2_

- [ ] 8. Implement backward compatibility verification
  - Create tests to ensure localhost access still works after changes
  - Verify all existing functionality remains intact when accessing via localhost
  - Test session consistency between localhost and network IP access
  - _Requirements: 4.1, 4.3_
