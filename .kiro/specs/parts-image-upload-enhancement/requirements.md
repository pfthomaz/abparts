# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature enhances the existing parts image upload system to use a well-organized file system structure on the VM, with proper image management, validation, and serving capabilities. The current implementation uses basic local storage with minimal organization. This enhancement will provide a robust, production-ready image management system for parts with proper file organization, validation, and cleanup capabilities.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a super admin, I want to upload multiple images for parts with proper file organization and validation, so that images are stored securely and efficiently on the VM file system.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a super admin uploads an image THEN the system SHALL store the image in a structured directory format `/app/static/images/parts/{part_id}/` within the container
2. WHEN an image is uploaded THEN the system SHALL validate file type (JPEG, PNG, WebP only) and file size (max 5MB per image)
3. WHEN an image is uploaded THEN the system SHALL generate a unique filename with timestamp and UUID to prevent conflicts
4. WHEN multiple images are uploaded for the same part THEN the system SHALL organize them in the same part-specific directory
5. IF the upload directory does not exist THEN the system SHALL create it automatically with proper permissions

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a super admin, I want to manage existing part images (view, replace, delete), so that I can maintain accurate visual information for parts.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a super admin requests part images THEN the system SHALL return a list of all images for that part with their URLs and metadata
2. WHEN a super admin deletes an image THEN the system SHALL remove the file from the file system and update the part record
3. WHEN a super admin replaces an image THEN the system SHALL delete the old file and store the new one in the same directory
4. WHEN a part is deleted THEN the system SHALL optionally clean up associated image files from the file system
5. IF an image file is missing from the file system THEN the system SHALL handle the error gracefully and update the database

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As any authenticated user, I want to view part images efficiently, so that I can see visual information about parts in the system.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user requests a part with images THEN the system SHALL serve images through a static file endpoint
2. WHEN images are served THEN the system SHALL include proper HTTP headers for caching and content type
3. WHEN an image URL is accessed THEN the system SHALL return the image file or a 404 if not found
4. WHEN multiple images exist for a part THEN the system SHALL return them in a consistent order (by upload date)
5. IF an image is corrupted or unreadable THEN the system SHALL return an appropriate error response

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the image storage system to be properly integrated with Docker volumes, so that images persist across container restarts and can be backed up.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the container starts THEN the system SHALL use the existing Docker volume mount for persistent storage
2. WHEN images are stored THEN they SHALL be accessible from the host VM file system through the volume mount
3. WHEN the container is restarted THEN all previously uploaded images SHALL remain accessible
4. WHEN the system runs in production THEN the image storage SHALL use the production volume configuration
5. IF the volume mount fails THEN the system SHALL log appropriate errors and fail gracefully

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a super admin, I want comprehensive image upload validation and error handling, so that only valid images are stored and errors are clearly communicated.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an invalid file type is uploaded THEN the system SHALL return a 400 error with specific file type requirements
2. WHEN a file exceeds size limits THEN the system SHALL return a 413 error with size limit information
3. WHEN disk space is insufficient THEN the system SHALL return a 507 error and prevent partial uploads
4. WHEN upload fails due to permissions THEN the system SHALL return a 500 error with appropriate logging
5. WHEN multiple images are uploaded simultaneously THEN the system SHALL validate each file independently and report specific errors

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the image upload system to integrate seamlessly with the existing parts API, so that image management is part of the standard parts workflow.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN creating a part THEN the system SHALL optionally accept image uploads in the same request
2. WHEN updating a part THEN the system SHALL allow adding, removing, or replacing images
3. WHEN retrieving parts THEN the system SHALL include image URLs in the response if images exist
4. WHEN searching parts THEN the system SHALL indicate which parts have images available
5. IF image operations fail during part creation/update THEN the system SHALL handle the transaction appropriately
