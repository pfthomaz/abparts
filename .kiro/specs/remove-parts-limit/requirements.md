# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The ABParts system currently has a documented scale requirement limiting the parts catalog to a maximum of 200 different parts. This limit is mentioned in the product overview documentation but is not enforced by any technical constraints in the application. As the business grows and expands its parts catalog, this artificial limit needs to be removed to allow unlimited parts management. This feature will remove the conceptual limit and ensure the system can handle an unlimited number of parts efficiently.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Remove Documentation Limits

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the parts catalog to support unlimited parts without artificial constraints, so that the business can grow its inventory without technical limitations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN reviewing system documentation THEN there SHALL be no mention of a maximum 200 parts limit
2. WHEN the product overview is updated THEN it SHALL reflect unlimited parts capacity
3. WHEN scale requirements are documented THEN they SHALL focus on performance considerations rather than arbitrary limits
4. WHEN new users review the system capabilities THEN they SHALL understand that parts management is unlimited
5. IF performance considerations exist THEN they SHALL be documented separately from business limits

### Requirement 2: Validate System Performance

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to ensure the system can handle large numbers of parts efficiently, so that removing the limit doesn't impact performance.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the parts API is called with large datasets THEN it SHALL maintain acceptable response times
2. WHEN pagination is used THEN it SHALL efficiently handle large parts catalogs
3. WHEN searching parts THEN the search functionality SHALL perform well with thousands of parts
4. WHEN filtering parts THEN the filtering SHALL remain responsive with large datasets
5. IF performance degrades THEN appropriate indexing and optimization SHALL be implemented

### Requirement 3: Update Test Data Constraints

**User Story:** As a developer, I want test data generation to reflect the unlimited parts capability, so that testing covers realistic scenarios.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN generating test data THEN the system SHALL support creating more than 200 parts for testing
2. WHEN running performance tests THEN they SHALL include scenarios with large parts catalogs
3. WHEN validating migrations THEN they SHALL handle datasets larger than 200 parts
4. WHEN testing pagination THEN it SHALL work correctly with large parts datasets
5. IF test environments need large datasets THEN they SHALL be configurable beyond 200 parts

### Requirement 4: Frontend Scalability

**User Story:** As a user managing a large parts catalog, I want the parts management interface to remain responsive and usable, so that I can efficiently work with thousands of parts.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing the parts page THEN it SHALL load efficiently regardless of total parts count
2. WHEN searching parts THEN the search SHALL provide fast results even with large catalogs
3. WHEN filtering parts THEN the filters SHALL respond quickly with large datasets
4. WHEN paginating through parts THEN the pagination SHALL work smoothly with large catalogs
5. IF the UI becomes slow THEN appropriate optimization techniques SHALL be implemented

### Requirement 5: Database Optimization

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the database to handle large parts catalogs efficiently, so that system performance remains optimal as the catalog grows.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN querying parts THEN the database SHALL use appropriate indexes for fast retrieval
2. WHEN searching parts by name or number THEN the queries SHALL be optimized for performance
3. WHEN joining parts with inventory data THEN the joins SHALL be efficient for large datasets
4. WHEN filtering parts by type or properties THEN the filters SHALL use proper indexing
5. IF query performance degrades THEN additional database optimizations SHALL be implemented

### Requirement 6: API Endpoint Optimization

**User Story:** As an API consumer, I want the parts endpoints to handle large catalogs efficiently, so that integrations remain performant as the catalog grows.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN calling GET /parts THEN the endpoint SHALL support efficient pagination for large datasets
2. WHEN searching parts via API THEN the search SHALL return results quickly regardless of catalog size
3. WHEN filtering parts via API THEN the filters SHALL perform efficiently with large datasets
4. WHEN retrieving parts with inventory THEN the endpoint SHALL optimize the data retrieval
5. IF API response times increase THEN appropriate caching and optimization SHALL be implemented
