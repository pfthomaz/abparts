# Implementation Plan

- [x] 1. Update documentation to remove parts limits





  - Remove the "Maximum 200 different parts in catalog" constraint from product documentation
  - Update scale requirements to focus on performance rather than arbitrary limits
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.2, 1.3, 1.4_

- [x] 2. Enhance database indexing for performance





  - Create composite index on (part_type, is_proprietary) for efficient filtering
  - Add index on manufacturer field for manufacturer-based queries
  - Implement full-text search index on name field for multilingual search
  - _Requirements: 5.1, 5.2, 5.3, 5.4_

- [x] 3. Update test data generation to support large datasets





  - Modify test configuration to allow generating more than 200 parts
  - Update performance test data generation functions to support configurable large datasets
  - Create test scenarios with 1,000, 5,000, and 10,000+ parts
  - _Requirements: 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, 3.4, 3.5_

- [x] 4. Optimize parts API endpoints for large datasets






  - Add optional result counting parameter to parts endpoints
  - Implement query performance monitoring in CRUD operations
  - Add response caching headers for frequently accessed parts data
  - _Requirements: 6.1, 6.2, 6.3, 6.4, 6.5_

- [x] 5. Enhance frontend search performance






  - Implement debounced search in parts management interface
  - Add progressive loading indicators for large datasets
  - Optimize component re-rendering for better performance with large parts lists
  - _Requirements: 4.1, 4.2, 4.3, 4.4_

- [x] 6. Create comprehensive performance tests





  - Write performance tests for parts API with large datasets
  - Create frontend performance tests for parts management interface
  - Implement database query performance validation tests
  - _Requirements: 2.1, 2.2, 2.3, 2.4, 2.5_

- [x] 7. Add performance monitoring and alerting





  - Implement query execution time logging in parts CRUD operations
  - Add API response time monitoring for parts endpoints
  - Create performance benchmarks and validation tests
  - _Requirements: 2.1, 2.2, 2.3, 2.4, 2.5_

- [x] 8. Validate system scalability with large datasets








  - Test parts creation, search, and filtering with 10,000+ parts
  - Validate pagination performance with large parts catalogs
  - Ensure frontend remains responsive with large datasets
  - _Requirements: 2.1, 2.2, 2.3, 2.4, 4.1, 4.2, 4.3, 4.4_

- [x] 9. Fix frontend data synchronization after part creation
  - Fix parts list not refreshing after creating new parts
  - Ensure search functionality includes newly created parts
  - Update analytics counters to reflect new parts immediately
  - Verify both regular and superadmin interfaces refresh properly
  - _Requirements: 4.1, 4.2, 4.3, 4.4_
