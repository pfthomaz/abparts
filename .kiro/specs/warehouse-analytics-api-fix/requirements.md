# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The warehouse inventory analytics feature is currently failing due to missing or misconfigured backend API endpoints. Users are experiencing "Failed to fetch warehouse analytics" errors and 404 responses when trying to access warehouse inventory data. This prevents users from viewing critical inventory analytics and warehouse-specific inventory information.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a warehouse manager, I want to view warehouse inventory analytics so that I can monitor inventory levels and make informed decisions about stock management.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user navigates to the warehouse inventory analytics page THEN the system SHALL successfully fetch warehouse analytics data from the backend API
2. WHEN the warehouse analytics API is called THEN the system SHALL return a 200 status code with valid inventory data
3. IF the warehouse analytics data is unavailable THEN the system SHALL display an appropriate error message to the user
4. WHEN warehouse analytics data is successfully retrieved THEN the system SHALL display the data in the analytics dashboard

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the warehouse inventory API endpoints to be properly configured so that all warehouse-related functionality works correctly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system starts THEN all warehouse inventory API endpoints SHALL be properly registered and accessible
2. WHEN a request is made to `/inventory/warehouse/` endpoints THEN the system SHALL route the request to the correct handler
3. IF an API endpoint is missing THEN the system SHALL return a proper 404 error with descriptive messaging
4. WHEN API endpoints are accessed THEN the system SHALL validate authentication and authorization properly

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive error handling for warehouse analytics API calls so that users receive meaningful feedback when issues occur.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an API call fails due to network issues THEN the system SHALL display a user-friendly error message
2. WHEN an API call fails due to server errors THEN the system SHALL log the error details for debugging
3. IF warehouse data is malformed or invalid THEN the system SHALL handle the error gracefully without crashing
4. WHEN API calls are in progress THEN the system SHALL show appropriate loading indicators to users

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a quality assurance engineer, I want the warehouse analytics API to be thoroughly tested so that we can prevent similar issues in the future.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN warehouse analytics API endpoints are implemented THEN they SHALL have comprehensive unit tests
2. WHEN API integration is complete THEN there SHALL be integration tests covering success and failure scenarios
3. IF API endpoints change THEN the tests SHALL be updated to reflect the changes
4. WHEN tests are run THEN they SHALL validate both the API response structure and error handling
