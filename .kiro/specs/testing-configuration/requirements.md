# Testing Configuration Requirements

## Introduction

This specification defines the requirements for setting up a comprehensive testing framework for the ABParts inventory management system. The testing configuration should support unit tests, integration tests, and API endpoint testing with proper database isolation and test data management.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Test Framework Setup

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a properly configured testing framework so that I can write and run tests reliably across the application.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the testing framework is configured THEN the system SHALL use pytest as the primary testing framework
2. WHEN tests are executed THEN the system SHALL provide clear test output with coverage reporting
3. WHEN tests are run THEN the system SHALL support both unit and integration test execution
4. WHEN the test suite is executed THEN the system SHALL complete within reasonable time limits
5. WHEN tests fail THEN the system SHALL provide detailed error messages and stack traces

### Requirement 2: Database Testing Configuration

**User Story:** As a developer, I want isolated test database configuration so that tests don't interfere with development data and can run reliably.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN tests are executed THEN the system SHALL use a separate test database instance
2. WHEN each test runs THEN the system SHALL provide a clean database state
3. WHEN tests complete THEN the system SHALL automatically clean up test data
4. WHEN database tests run THEN the system SHALL support transaction rollback for isolation
5. WHEN test fixtures are needed THEN the system SHALL provide reusable test data factories

### Requirement 3: API Testing Configuration

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to test API endpoints with proper authentication and request/response validation so that I can ensure API reliability.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN API tests run THEN the system SHALL provide a test client for making HTTP requests
2. WHEN API endpoints are tested THEN the system SHALL support authentication testing
3. WHEN API responses are validated THEN the system SHALL verify status codes and response schemas
4. WHEN API tests execute THEN the system SHALL test both success and error scenarios
5. WHEN API tests run THEN the system SHALL validate request/response data against Pydantic schemas

### Requirement 4: Test Organization and Discovery

**User Story:** As a developer, I want tests to be properly organized and discoverable so that I can easily run specific test suites or individual tests.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN tests are organized THEN the system SHALL follow a clear directory structure matching the application structure
2. WHEN test discovery runs THEN the system SHALL automatically find all test files following naming conventions
3. WHEN tests are categorized THEN the system SHALL support running unit tests, integration tests, and API tests separately
4. WHEN test files are created THEN the system SHALL follow consistent naming patterns (test_*.py)
5. WHEN tests are executed THEN the system SHALL support running tests by module, class, or individual test function

### Requirement 5: Test Configuration Management

**User Story:** As a developer, I want centralized test configuration so that test settings are consistent and easily maintainable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN tests are configured THEN the system SHALL use environment-specific configuration files
2. WHEN test settings are needed THEN the system SHALL provide a centralized test configuration module
3. WHEN test databases are configured THEN the system SHALL use separate connection strings for testing
4. WHEN test environments are set up THEN the system SHALL support different configurations for local vs CI testing
5. WHEN configuration changes THEN the system SHALL not require code changes in individual test files

### Requirement 6: Test Coverage and Reporting

**User Story:** As a developer, I want test coverage reporting so that I can identify untested code and maintain high code quality.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN tests run THEN the system SHALL generate code coverage reports
2. WHEN coverage is measured THEN the system SHALL report coverage percentages by module and overall
3. WHEN coverage reports are generated THEN the system SHALL identify uncovered lines of code
4. WHEN test results are produced THEN the system SHALL generate both console and HTML coverage reports
5. WHEN coverage thresholds are set THEN the system SHALL fail builds if coverage falls below minimum requirements

### Requirement 7: Continuous Integration Testing

**User Story:** As a developer, I want tests to run automatically in CI/CD pipelines so that code quality is maintained across all deployments.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN code is committed THEN the system SHALL automatically run the full test suite
2. WHEN CI tests run THEN the system SHALL use containerized test environments
3. WHEN test failures occur THEN the system SHALL prevent deployment and notify developers
4. WHEN CI tests execute THEN the system SHALL run in parallel where possible for faster feedback
5. WHEN test results are available THEN the system SHALL integrate with development tools for reporting

### Requirement 8: Test Data Management

**User Story:** As a developer, I want consistent test data management so that tests are reliable and maintainable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN test data is needed THEN the system SHALL provide factory functions for creating test objects
2. WHEN tests require specific data THEN the system SHALL support fixtures for common test scenarios
3. WHEN test data is created THEN the system SHALL ensure data consistency with application models
4. WHEN tests need authentication THEN the system SHALL provide helper functions for creating test users and tokens
5. WHEN test cleanup occurs THEN the system SHALL automatically remove test data without affecting other tests
