# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for implementing a Model Context Protocol (MCP) server that can scrape websites to extract visual elements such as logos, UI styling, and color palettes. This feature will enable users to analyze and extract design elements from websites for reference, inspiration, or competitive analysis.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to extract logos from websites, so that I can reference them in design documents or analyze branding elements.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user provides a URL THEN the system SHALL extract the primary logo from the website.
2. WHEN a website has multiple logo variants (dark/light) THEN the system SHALL attempt to extract all variants.
3. WHEN a logo is extracted THEN the system SHALL provide the image in its original format.
4. WHEN a logo extraction fails THEN the system SHALL provide a meaningful error message.
5. WHEN a logo is vector-based (SVG) THEN the system SHALL preserve the vector format.

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a designer, I want to extract color palettes from websites, so that I can understand color schemes and apply similar aesthetics to my projects.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user provides a URL THEN the system SHALL extract the dominant colors used on the website.
2. WHEN colors are extracted THEN the system SHALL provide them in multiple formats (HEX, RGB, HSL).
3. WHEN a website uses a gradient THEN the system SHALL identify and extract the gradient colors.
4. WHEN colors are extracted THEN the system SHALL categorize them (primary, secondary, accent, background, text).
5. WHEN a color palette is extracted THEN the system SHALL provide color relationships (complementary, analogous).

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a frontend developer, I want to extract UI styling information from websites, so that I can understand their design systems and implement similar components.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user provides a URL THEN the system SHALL extract typography information (font families, sizes, weights).
2. WHEN a user provides a URL THEN the system SHALL extract spacing patterns and layout information.
3. WHEN a user provides a URL THEN the system SHALL extract component styles (buttons, forms, cards).
4. WHEN CSS frameworks are detected THEN the system SHALL identify them (Bootstrap, Tailwind, etc.).
5. WHEN responsive breakpoints are detected THEN the system SHALL document them.

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want to integrate the website scraper with Kiro through MCP, so that I can use it seamlessly within my development workflow.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the MCP server is configured THEN the system SHALL register itself with Kiro.
2. WHEN a user invokes the scraper through Kiro THEN the system SHALL process the request and return results in a structured format.
3. WHEN the MCP server encounters rate limiting or blocking THEN the system SHALL handle it gracefully and inform the user.
4. WHEN the MCP server is used THEN the system SHALL respect robots.txt and ethical scraping practices.
5. WHEN multiple requests are made THEN the system SHALL implement appropriate caching to avoid redundant scraping.

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to customize the scraping parameters, so that I can focus on specific elements or pages of interest.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user provides specific CSS selectors THEN the system SHALL target those elements for extraction.
2. WHEN a user wants to scrape multiple pages THEN the system SHALL support batch processing.
3. WHEN a user wants to exclude certain elements THEN the system SHALL honor those exclusions.
4. WHEN a user wants to compare multiple websites THEN the system SHALL support side-by-side analysis.
5. WHEN a user wants to export results THEN the system SHALL provide multiple export formats (JSON, CSV, PDF).
