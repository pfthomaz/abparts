# Requirements Document: Inventory Transfer Fix

## Introduction

The ABParts inventory transfer functionality is currently experiencing critical errors when users attempt to transfer inventory between warehouses. The system is encountering type conversion issues between decimal.Decimal and float types, causing API failures and preventing successful inventory transfers. This document outlines the requirements to fix the inventory transfer system and ensure reliable warehouse-to-warehouse inventory movements.

## Error Context

Current issues observed:
- API errors with unsupported operand types for 'decimal.Decimal' and 'float'
- Inventory transfer operations failing at the backend level
- Frontend showing transfer dialog but backend operations not completing successfully
- Type conversion issues in inventory calculations

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Backend Data Type Consistency

**User Story:** As a developer, I want consistent data type handling in inventory operations, so that decimal quantities are properly processed without type conversion errors.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN processing inventory quantities THEN the system SHALL use consistent decimal.Decimal types throughout all calculations
2. WHEN receiving quantity inputs from the frontend THEN the system SHALL convert them to decimal.Decimal before processing
3. WHEN performing arithmetic operations on quantities THEN the system SHALL ensure all operands are of the same decimal type
4. WHEN storing quantities in the database THEN the system SHALL maintain decimal precision without float conversion
5. WHEN returning quantity data to the frontend THEN the system SHALL serialize decimal values properly
6. WHEN validating quantity inputs THEN the system SHALL handle both integer and decimal inputs correctly

### Requirement 2: Inventory Transfer API Reliability

**User Story:** As a user, I want inventory transfers between warehouses to complete successfully, so that I can move stock between locations without system errors.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN initiating an inventory transfer THEN the system SHALL validate source warehouse has sufficient stock
2. WHEN processing a transfer THEN the system SHALL atomically decrease source inventory and increase destination inventory
3. WHEN a transfer fails THEN the system SHALL rollback any partial changes to maintain data consistency
4. WHEN transfer validation fails THEN the system SHALL return clear error messages to the frontend
5. WHEN a transfer completes successfully THEN the system SHALL return updated inventory levels for both warehouses
6. WHEN processing bulk material transfers THEN the system SHALL handle decimal quantities correctly

### Requirement 3: Frontend Transfer Interface Robustness

**User Story:** As a user, I want the inventory transfer interface to handle errors gracefully and provide clear feedback, so that I understand the status of my transfer operations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a transfer API call fails THEN the system SHALL display the specific error message instead of generic errors
2. WHEN submitting a transfer THEN the system SHALL disable the form to prevent duplicate submissions
3. WHEN a transfer is processing THEN the system SHALL show a loading indicator
4. WHEN a transfer completes successfully THEN the system SHALL show success feedback and refresh inventory data
5. WHEN a transfer fails THEN the system SHALL allow the user to retry or modify the transfer
6. WHEN displaying available stock THEN the system SHALL show real-time inventory levels

### Requirement 4: Data Validation and Error Handling

**User Story:** As a user, I want comprehensive validation of transfer requests, so that I receive clear guidance when my transfer cannot be completed.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN entering transfer quantities THEN the system SHALL validate the quantity is positive and within available stock
2. WHEN selecting source and destination warehouses THEN the system SHALL prevent transfers to the same warehouse
3. WHEN submitting a transfer THEN the system SHALL validate user permissions for both warehouses
4. WHEN insufficient stock exists THEN the system SHALL display available quantity and suggest valid amounts
5. WHEN warehouse access is restricted THEN the system SHALL provide clear permission error messages
6. WHEN network errors occur THEN the system SHALL distinguish between connectivity and server errors

### Requirement 5: Transaction Logging and Audit Trail

**User Story:** As an admin, I want complete audit trails of inventory transfers, so that I can track all stock movements and troubleshoot issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a transfer is initiated THEN the system SHALL log the transfer request with user, timestamps, and quantities
2. WHEN a transfer completes THEN the system SHALL record the successful transaction with before/after inventory levels
3. WHEN a transfer fails THEN the system SHALL log the failure reason and any partial operations
4. WHEN viewing transfer history THEN the system SHALL show chronological transfer records with full details
5. WHEN investigating inventory discrepancies THEN the system SHALL provide transfer logs for reconciliation
6. WHEN transfers are reversed THEN the system SHALL maintain the audit trail of both original and reversal transactions

### Requirement 6: Inventory Consistency and Reconciliation

**User Story:** As an inventory manager, I want inventory levels to remain accurate across all transfers, so that stock counts are reliable for business operations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN transfers are processed THEN the system SHALL maintain inventory balance across all warehouses
2. WHEN concurrent transfers occur THEN the system SHALL use database locking to prevent race conditions
3. WHEN system errors interrupt transfers THEN the system SHALL detect and flag incomplete transactions
4. WHEN inventory discrepancies are detected THEN the system SHALL provide reconciliation tools
5. WHEN viewing total inventory THEN the system SHALL accurately sum quantities across all warehouses
6. WHEN generating inventory reports THEN the system SHALL include transfer activities in stock movement calculations

### Requirement 7: Performance and Scalability

**User Story:** As a user, I want inventory transfers to process quickly and reliably, so that I can efficiently manage stock movements.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN processing transfers THEN the system SHALL complete operations within 2 seconds for normal quantities
2. WHEN handling multiple concurrent transfers THEN the system SHALL maintain performance without degradation
3. WHEN transferring large quantities THEN the system SHALL process them efficiently without timeouts
4. WHEN the system is under load THEN transfer operations SHALL maintain priority for business continuity
5. WHEN database connections are limited THEN the system SHALL manage connections efficiently for transfer operations
6. WHEN caching inventory data THEN the system SHALL invalidate cache appropriately after transfers

### Requirement 8: User Experience and Feedback

**User Story:** As a user, I want clear and immediate feedback during inventory transfers, so that I can confidently complete stock movements.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN starting a transfer THEN the system SHALL provide clear progress indicators
2. WHEN a transfer is successful THEN the system SHALL show confirmation with updated inventory levels
3. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL provide actionable error messages with suggested solutions
4. WHEN viewing transfer history THEN the system SHALL show recent transfers with status and details
5. WHEN transfers are pending THEN the system SHALL indicate processing status
6. WHEN multiple transfers are queued THEN the system SHALL show queue status and estimated completion times
