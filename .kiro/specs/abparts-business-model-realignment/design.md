# ABParts Business Model Realignment Design

## Overview

This design document provides a comprehensive analysis of the required changes to align the ABParts system with the detailed business requirements. The approach prioritizes minimal-impact extensions to the existing architecture while ensuring full business requirement compliance.

## Architecture

The current ABParts system follows a three-tier architecture:
- **Frontend**: React SPA with role-based UI components
- **Backend**: FastAPI with SQLAlchemy ORM and PostgreSQL
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with enum-based business rules

The realignment will extend this architecture with:
- Enhanced organizational hierarchy management
- Country-based localization support
- Multilingual data handling
- Advanced role-based access control
- Service management framework (future)

## Components and Interfaces

### Database Model Extensions

#### 1. Organization Model Enhancements
**Current State**: Basic organization types and hierarchy support exists
**Required Changes**:
- Add `country` field with enum constraint ['GR', 'KSA', 'ES', 'CY', 'OM']
- Enhance supplier-customer relationship validation
- Add default organization seeding for Oraseas EE and BossAqua

#### 2. Parts Model Enhancements  
**Current State**: Basic part information with type classification
**Required Changes**:
- Extend `name` field to support multilingual compound strings
- Add `manufacturer` field (separate from is_proprietary flag)
- Add `part_code` field for AutoBoss-specific codes
- Add `serial_number` field (optional)
- Extend `image_urls` array to support up to 4 images
- Ensure `part_type` enum supports both CONSUMABLE and BULK_MATERIAL

#### 3. Machine Model Enhancements
**Current State**: Basic machine registration with customer relationship
**Required Changes**:
- Add `model_type` enum with ['V3.1B', 'V4.0'] values
- Enhance `name` field for customer customization
- Add machine hours tracking relationship
- Add service history relationship (future enhancement)

#### 4. New Models Required

##### MachineHours Model
```
- id: UUID (PK)
- machine_id: UUID (FK to machines)
- recorded_by_user_id: UUID (FK to users)  
- hours_value: DECIMAL
- recorded_date: DATETIME
- notes: TEXT (optional)
```

##### ServiceRecommendation Model (Future)
```
- id: UUID (PK)
- service_type: ENUM ['50h', '250h', '500h', '750h', 'custom']
- checklist_items: JSONB
- required_parts: JSONB
- created_by_user_id: UUID (FK to users)
```

### Backend API Extensions

ALTER TABLE organizations 
ADD COLUMN country VARCHAR(3) CHECK (country IN ('GR', 'KSA', 'ES', 'CY', 'OM'));

-- Add constraint for supplier parent requirement
ALTER TABLE organizations 
ADD CONSTRAINT supplier_parent_required 
CHECK (organization_type != 'supplier' OR parent_organization_id IS NOT NULL);
```

### Enhanced Parts Schema  
```sql
ALTER TABLE parts
ADD COLUMN manufacturer VARCHAR(255),
ADD COLUMN part_code VARCHAR(100),
ADD COLUMN serial_number VARCHAR(255);

-- Update name field to support longer multilingual strings
ALTER TABLE parts ALTER COLUMN name TYPE TEXT;
```

### New MachineHours Schema
```sql
CREATE TABLE machine_hours (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT uuid_generate_v4(),
    machine_id UUID NOT NULL REFERENCES machines(id),
    recorded_by_user_id UUID NOT NULL REFERENCES users(id),
    hours_value DECIMAL(10,2) NOT NULL,
    recorded_date TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE NOT NULL,
    notes TEXT,
    created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW(),
    updated_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW()
);
```
