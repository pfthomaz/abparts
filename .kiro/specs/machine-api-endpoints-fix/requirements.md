# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The machine-related API endpoints are returning "Internal Server Error" (500 status) when accessed from the frontend. The errors are occurring across multiple machine endpoints including machine details, machine usage history, and machine maintenance endpoints. This indicates there are underlying issues with the machine API implementation that need to be resolved to ensure the machine management functionality works correctly in the frontend application.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user viewing machine details, I want to successfully load machine information without encountering server errors, so that I can view and manage machine data effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user clicks on a machine to view details THEN the system SHALL successfully return machine data without 500 errors
2. WHEN the machine details endpoint is called THEN the system SHALL return complete machine information including all required fields
3. WHEN machine data includes enum fields (like status) THEN the system SHALL properly serialize enum values for the frontend
4. WHEN machine data includes related organization information THEN the system SHALL include organization names and relationships

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user managing machines, I want all machine-related API endpoints to function correctly, so that I can perform machine operations without encountering server errors.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN any machine endpoint is called THEN the system SHALL handle database queries without throwing unhandled exceptions
2. WHEN machine endpoints access related data THEN the system SHALL properly join and serialize related table information
3. WHEN machine endpoints encounter data issues THEN the system SHALL return appropriate HTTP status codes with meaningful error messages
4. WHEN machine endpoints are accessed with valid authentication THEN the system SHALL process requests successfully

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer debugging machine API issues, I want proper error handling and logging, so that I can identify and resolve issues quickly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN machine endpoints encounter errors THEN the system SHALL log detailed error information for debugging
2. WHEN database schema mismatches occur THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages indicating the specific issue
3. WHEN enum value mismatches occur THEN the system SHALL handle the conversion gracefully or provide specific error details
4. WHEN machine endpoints fail THEN the system SHALL return structured error responses that help identify the root cause

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want machine API endpoints to be consistent with the database schema, so that all machine operations work reliably.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN machine models are updated THEN the database schema SHALL be synchronized with the model definitions
2. WHEN enum types are used in machine models THEN the database enum types SHALL match the Python enum definitions
3. WHEN machine endpoints query the database THEN all referenced columns SHALL exist in the database tables
4. WHEN machine data is serialized THEN all field types SHALL be compatible between the database, models, and API responses
