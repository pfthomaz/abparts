# Parts Page Fix Requirements

## Introduction

The parts page at `http://localhost:3000/parts` is currently displaying an error "[object Object]" and showing "No Parts Found" even when parts may exist in the system. This indicates issues with error handling, API communication, and potentially missing backend functionality. This feature aims to fix the parts page to properly display parts with inventory information and provide clear error messages when issues occur.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Error Handling and Display

**User Story:** As a user accessing the parts page, I want to see clear and meaningful error messages when something goes wrong, so that I can understand what the issue is and potentially take corrective action.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an API call fails THEN the system SHALL display a human-readable error message instead of "[object Object]"
2. WHEN the error is a network issue THEN the system SHALL display "Unable to connect to server. Please check your connection and try again."
3. WHEN the error is an authentication issue THEN the system SHALL display "Authentication failed. Please log in again."
4. WHEN the error is a permission issue THEN the system SHALL display "You don't have permission to view parts."
5. WHEN the error is a server error THEN the system SHALL display the specific error message from the server
6. WHEN an error occurs THEN the system SHALL log the full error details to the browser console for debugging

### Requirement 2: Parts Data Loading

**User Story:** As a user, I want to see all parts with their inventory information when I visit the parts page, so that I can view the current stock levels and part details.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the parts page loads THEN the system SHALL fetch parts with inventory information from the backend
2. WHEN parts exist in the system THEN the system SHALL display them in a grid layout with part details and inventory information
3. WHEN no parts exist in the system THEN the system SHALL display "There are no parts in the system yet" with an option to add parts (if user has permission)
4. WHEN parts are loading THEN the system SHALL display a loading indicator
5. WHEN inventory data is available THEN the system SHALL show total stock and warehouse-specific inventory
6. WHEN inventory data is missing THEN the system SHALL show "No inventory data available" for that part

### Requirement 3: API Endpoint Verification

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to ensure that all required API endpoints exist and function correctly, so that the frontend can successfully retrieve parts data.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the frontend calls `/parts/with-inventory` THEN the backend SHALL return a list of parts with inventory information
2. WHEN the user has proper permissions THEN the API SHALL return parts data successfully
3. WHEN the user lacks permissions THEN the API SHALL return a 403 error with a clear message
4. WHEN no parts exist THEN the API SHALL return an empty array with a 200 status code
5. WHEN the database is unavailable THEN the API SHALL return a 500 error with an appropriate message

### Requirement 4: Frontend Service Integration

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the parts service to properly handle API responses and errors, so that the UI can display appropriate feedback to users.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the partsService.getPartsWithInventory() is called THEN it SHALL return the data on success
2. WHEN an API error occurs THEN the service SHALL throw an error with a meaningful message
3. WHEN the response is malformed THEN the service SHALL handle it gracefully and provide a fallback error message
4. WHEN the API returns an error object THEN the service SHALL extract and return the error message
5. WHEN network issues occur THEN the service SHALL provide a user-friendly error message

### Requirement 5: Component State Management

**User Story:** As a user, I want the parts page to properly manage loading states and error states, so that I have clear feedback about what's happening.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the page first loads THEN the loading state SHALL be true and display a loading indicator
2. WHEN data is successfully fetched THEN the loading state SHALL be false and parts SHALL be displayed
3. WHEN an error occurs THEN the loading state SHALL be false and error state SHALL contain the error message
4. WHEN the user retries after an error THEN the error state SHALL be cleared and loading state SHALL be set to true
5. WHEN parts data changes THEN the component SHALL re-render with updated information

### Requirement 6: Fallback and Recovery

**User Story:** As a user experiencing issues with the parts page, I want options to retry or recover from errors, so that I can continue using the application.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an error occurs THEN the system SHALL provide a "Retry" button to attempt loading parts again
2. WHEN the retry button is clicked THEN the system SHALL clear the error state and attempt to fetch parts again
3. WHEN multiple consecutive errors occur THEN the system SHALL suggest checking network connection or contacting support
4. WHEN the backend is unavailable THEN the system SHALL provide guidance on next steps
5. WHEN authentication expires THEN the system SHALL redirect to login or provide a re-authentication option
