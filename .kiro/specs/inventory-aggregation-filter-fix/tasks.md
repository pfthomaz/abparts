# Implementation Plan

- [x] 1. Create data validation utilities for inventory aggregation





  - Create helper functions to validate and extract inventory data from API responses
  - Implement safe array operation wrappers to prevent runtime errors
  - Add TypeScript-style JSDoc comments for better type safety
  - _Requirements: 2.1, 2.2_

- [x] 2. Fix the primary data extraction issue in WarehouseInventoryAggregationView





  - Update the `fetchData()` function to properly extract `inventory_summary` from the API response object
  - Add immediate data validation to prevent the "filter is not a function" error
  - Implement fallback behavior for malformed API responses
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.2, 1.3_

- [x] 3. Implement defensive programming throughout the component





  - Replace all direct array operations with safe wrapper functions
  - Add null/undefined checks before all data operations
  - Implement proper error boundaries around risky operations
  - _Requirements: 1.4, 2.3, 3.1_

- [x] 4. Enhance error handling and user feedback





  - Improve error messages to be more user-friendly and actionable
  - Add proper error logging for debugging purposes
  - Implement loading state management to prevent operations on undefined data
  - _Requirements: 3.1, 3.2, 3.4_

- [x] 5. Add comprehensive unit tests for data validation








  - Write tests for data validation helper functions with various input types
  - Test component behavior with different API response structures
  - Add tests for error scenarios and fallback behavior
  - _Requirements: 2.1, 2.2, 2.4_

- [x] 6. Create integration tests for the fixed component



  - Test the component with actual backend API responses in Docker environment
  - Verify proper rendering with various data states
  - Test user interactions (filtering, search) work correctly after the fix
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.3, 3.3_

- [x] 7. Validate the fix resolves the runtime errors



  - Test the component in the Docker development environment
  - Verify no "filter is not a function" errors occur
  - Confirm all inventory operations work correctly with the new data handling
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.2, 1.4, 3.4_
