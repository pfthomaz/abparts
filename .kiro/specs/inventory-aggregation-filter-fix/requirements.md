# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature addresses critical runtime errors in the warehouse inventory aggregation functionality where `aggregatedInventory.filter` is being called on a non-array value, causing the application to crash. The errors are occurring in the WarehouseInventoryAggregationView component and related inventory filtering operations. This fix ensures proper data type handling and error resilience in inventory aggregation operations.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user viewing warehouse inventory, I want the inventory aggregation to work reliably without runtime errors, so that I can access inventory data without application crashes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the WarehouseInventoryAggregationView component loads THEN the system SHALL ensure aggregatedInventory is always an array before calling filter methods
2. WHEN inventory data is undefined or null THEN the system SHALL provide a default empty array value
3. WHEN the inventory aggregation API returns unexpected data types THEN the system SHALL handle the error gracefully without crashing
4. WHEN filtering operations are performed on inventory data THEN the system SHALL validate the data is an array before applying filter methods

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want proper error handling and data validation in inventory components, so that similar type-related errors are prevented in the future.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN inventory data is received from API calls THEN the system SHALL validate the data structure before processing
2. WHEN data validation fails THEN the system SHALL log appropriate error messages and provide fallback behavior
3. WHEN inventory aggregation functions are called THEN the system SHALL include defensive programming practices to handle edge cases
4. WHEN similar array operations are performed elsewhere THEN the system SHALL follow consistent data validation patterns

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want inventory operations to be resilient to data inconsistencies, so that I can continue using the application even when backend data has issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the backend returns malformed inventory data THEN the frontend SHALL display appropriate user-friendly error messages
2. WHEN inventory aggregation fails THEN the system SHALL provide alternative views or retry mechanisms
3. WHEN data loading is in progress THEN the system SHALL show appropriate loading states instead of attempting operations on undefined data
4. WHEN inventory operations encounter errors THEN the system SHALL maintain application stability and allow users to continue with other functions
