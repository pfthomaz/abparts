# Mobile-Responsive Enhancements Test Guide

This document outlines the mobile enhancements implemented for ABParts and how to test them.

## Implemented Features

- Active states with scale animations (active:scale-95)
- Larger icons and text on mobile
- Better spacing and padding for finger navigation
- Focus states with ring indicators for accessibility

**Test Instructions**:
1. Open the dashboard on a mobile device or use browser dev tools mobile view
2. Tap on dashboard boxes - they should feel responsive with visual feedback
3. Verify boxes are large enough for comfortable finger tapping
4. Check that hover states work on desktop and active states work on mobile

### 2. Simplified Mobile Navigation ✅

**Test Instructions**:
1. Navigate to a part form or photo gallery component
2. Tap "Camera" button to open camera interface
3. Grant camera permissions when prompted
4. Test photo capture functionality
5. Try switching between front/back cameras
6. Verify photos appear in gallery with delete options
7. Test file input fallback if camera is not available

### 4. Offline Capability for Machine Hours Recording ✅

**Location**: `frontend/src/components/MachineHoursRecorder.js` and `frontend/src/services/offlineService.js`

**Features**:
- Automatic offline detection
- Local storage of machine hours when offline
- Visual offline/online status indicators
- Automatic sync when connection restored
- Offline data management (view, delete unsaved records)
