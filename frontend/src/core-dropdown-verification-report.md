  - Warehouses (/warehouses)

INVENTORY:

OPERATIONS:
  - Machines (/machines)
  - Transactions (/transactions)

ADMINISTRATION:

```

### 4. Layout Component Integration

**✅ PASSED** - Layout component correctly renders Core dropdown:

- Core dropdown is visible when category is enabled and has items
- Dashboard item is correctly excluded from dropdown display
- Dropdown items display with proper descriptions and access scope indicators
- Hover effects and visual feedback work as expected

## Requirements Verification

### Requirement 1.1: Core dropdown displays appropriate items
✅ **VERIFIED** - Core dropdown shows Parts, Inventory, Orders, and Warehouses (when permitted)

### Requirement 1.3: Permission-based item visibility  
✅ **VERIFIED** - Items are hidden when user lacks permission (e.g., Warehouses for regular users)

- ✅ `getUIConfiguration()` properly enables core category
- ✅ Layout component renders core dropdown when enabled and populated
- ✅ Permission guards work correctly for all user roles
- ✅ Access scope indicators display properly

## Test Environment

- **Frontend Container:** abparts_web (running on port 3000)
- **Backend Container:** abparts_api (running on port 8000)  
- **Database:** PostgreSQL (running on port 5432)
- **All services:** Healthy and operational

## Conclusion
