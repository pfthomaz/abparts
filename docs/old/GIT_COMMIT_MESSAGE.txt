feat: implement hybrid storage solution for images

Store images in PostgreSQL database to permanently solve recurring
image sync issues between development and production environments.

Key Changes:
- Add binary storage columns (BYTEA) to users, organizations, and parts tables
- Implement automatic WebP compression (max 500KB per image)
- Create new image serving endpoints (/images/*)
- Update upload endpoints to use database storage
- Add image migration script for existing file-based images
- Add video infrastructure tables for future use
- Add Pillow dependency for image processing

Technical Details:
- Images automatically compressed to WebP format
- Multiple quality levels tried (85, 75, 60, 50, 40) to meet size limit
- Images served with proper cache headers (1-24 hours)
- Handles RGBA/PNG transparency by converting to RGB
- Supports multiple images per part (array of BYTEA)

Benefits:
- Images automatically sync with database backups/restores
- No more manual file copying between environments
- Transactional safety for image operations
- Simplified deployment and operations
- Better performance with WebP compression

Files Added:
- backend/app/image_utils.py - Image compression utilities
- backend/app/routers/images.py - Image serving endpoints
- backend/alembic/versions/add_hybrid_media_storage.py - Database migration
- migrate_images_to_db.py - Migration script for existing images
- Multiple deployment and documentation files

Files Modified:
- backend/app/models.py - Added binary storage columns and video models
- backend/app/routers/uploads.py - Updated to use database storage
- backend/app/main.py - Registered images router
- backend/requirements.txt - Added Pillow

Migration:
- Run: alembic upgrade heads
- Run: python migrate_images_to_db.py
- Existing file-based images automatically migrated to database
