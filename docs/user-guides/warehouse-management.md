# Warehouse Management Guide

This guide covers comprehensive warehouse management in ABParts, including setup, inventory tracking, and operational procedures for administrators.

## Understanding Warehouse-Based Inventory

ABParts uses a warehouse-centric inventory model where all inventory is tracked at the warehouse level rather than the organization level. This provides:

- **Location-specific tracking**: Know exactly where each part is stored
- **Multi-location support**: Manage inventory across multiple physical locations
- **Transfer capabilities**: Move inventory between warehouses
- **Detailed reporting**: Location-specific inventory reports and analytics
