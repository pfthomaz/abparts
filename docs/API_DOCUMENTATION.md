# ABParts API Documentation

**Version:** 2.0.0  
**Last Updated:** January 2025  
**Base URL:** `http://localhost:8000` (Development)  
**Production URL:** `https://api.yourdomain.com`  

---

## üìã **API Overview**

The ABParts API is a comprehensive RESTful API built with FastAPI, providing complete inventory and order management capabilities for the AutoBoss parts distribution ecosystem. The API has been fully aligned with the business model and features automatic OpenAPI documentation, JWT authentication, and role-based access control.

### **Business Model Integration**
The API now properly represents the AutoBoss parts ecosystem:
- **Oraseas EE**: Primary distributor and app owner (singleton organization)
- **BossAqua**: Manufacturer of AutoBoss machines and proprietary parts (singleton organization)
- **Customers**: Organizations that purchase AutoBoss machines and need parts (max 100)
- **Suppliers**: Third-party suppliers serving customers or Oraseas EE

### **Key Features**
- **RESTful Design:** Standard HTTP methods and status codes
- **JWT Authentication:** Secure token-based authentication with 8-hour expiration
- **Role-Based Access:** Three-tier permission system (user, admin, super_admin)
- **Organization Scoping:** Data access limited to user's organization (except super_admin)
- **Warehouse-Based Inventory:** Multi-warehouse support with real-time tracking
- **Transaction Audit Trail:** Complete tracking of all parts movements
- **Business Rule Enforcement:** Automatic validation of business constraints
- **Comprehensive Validation:** Pydantic schema validation
- **Auto-Generated Docs:** OpenAPI/Swagger documentation at `/docs`

### **Scale Requirements**
The API is designed to efficiently handle:
- Maximum 100 customer organizations
- Maximum 200 total users across all organizations
- Maximum 200 different parts in catalog
- Maximum 150 AutoBoss machines deployed
- Maximum 150 warehouses across all organizations
- Maximum 7,500 transactions per year (50 per machine)

---

## üîê **Authentication**

### **Authentication Flow**
1. **Login:** POST `/token` with username/password
2. **Receive JWT Token:** Use token in Authorization header
3. **Access Protected Endpoints:** Include `Authorization: Bearer <token>`

### **Token Management**
- **Expiration:** 8 hours
- **Refresh:** Re-authenticate when token expires
- **Security:** Automatic session cleanup and monitoring

```bash
# Login Example
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8000/token" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded" \
  -d "username=admin@example.com&password=password"

# Use Token
curl -X GET "http://localhost:8000/users/me/" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <your-jwt-token>"
```

## üë• **User Roles & Permissions**

### **Role Hierarchy**
1. **super_admin:** Full system access across all organizations (Oraseas EE only)
2. **admin:** Full access within their organization (can manage users, warehouses, inventory)
3. **user:** Limited access within their organization (can order parts, record usage, view inventory)

### **Permission Matrix**
| Permission | User | Admin | Super Admin |
|------------|------|-------|-------------|
| View own organization data | ‚úÖ | ‚úÖ | ‚úÖ |
| View all organizations data | ‚ùå | ‚ùå | ‚úÖ |
| Order parts | ‚úÖ | ‚úÖ | ‚úÖ |
| Record part usage | ‚úÖ | ‚úÖ | ‚úÖ |
| Check inventories | ‚úÖ | ‚úÖ | ‚úÖ |
| Create/edit warehouses | ‚ùå | ‚úÖ | ‚úÖ |
| Manage suppliers | ‚ùå | ‚úÖ | ‚úÖ |
| Adjust inventories | ‚ùå | ‚úÖ | ‚úÖ |
| Register machines | ‚ùå | ‚ùå | ‚úÖ |
| Invite users | ‚ùå | ‚úÖ | ‚úÖ |
| Manage users | ‚ùå | ‚úÖ | ‚úÖ |
| View audit logs | ‚ùå | ‚úÖ | ‚úÖ |

### **Permission Scoping**
- **Organization-Based:** Users can only access data from their organization
- **Role-Based:** Different endpoints require different permission levels
- **Super Admin Override:** Super admins can access cross-organization data
- **Business Rule Enforcement:** System enforces singleton constraints for Oraseas EE and BossAqua
