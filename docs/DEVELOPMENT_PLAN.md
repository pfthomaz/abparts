# üö¶ ABParts Development Plan: Implementation Prioritization

This review proposes a logical and technical priority order for the tasks in the development plan, aiming to minimize refactoring and architectural risk. The sequence is designed to establish foundational elements first, then build out user-facing features, and finally layer on enhancements and reporting.

---

## **1. Foundational & Cross-Cutting Concerns (Highest Priority)**

These tasks impact the architecture, data models, and security. Completing them first reduces the risk of major refactoring later.

- ‚¨úÔ∏è **User Management & Authentication Enhancements (Phase 3)**
  - User CRUD & Self-Service (backend & frontend)
  - Role assignment and editing
  - Password reset flow
  - JWT/session expiration and refresh logic
  - (Optional) User invitation/onboarding
- ‚¨úÔ∏è **Permissions & Roles (Phase 3 & 6)**
  - Expand backend permission model for fine-grained permissions
  - UI for managing user/role permissions
  - Map existing roles to new structure
- ‚¨úÔ∏è **Granular User Permissions (Phase 6)**
  - Ensure all endpoints and UI respect new permission model

---

## **2. Core Data Models & API Endpoints**

These are the backbone of the business logic. Implementing them early ensures all UI and workflows have a stable API to build on.

- ‚¨úÔ∏è **Inventory Management (Phase 1)**
  - Stock adjustment endpoints (with reason codes, audit trail)
  - Inventory location and transfer endpoints
  - Part categories and supplier relationships
  - Stocktake/cycle counting endpoints
- ‚¨úÔ∏è **Order Management (Phase 2)**
  - Order status transitions and fulfillment endpoints
  - Partial shipment/backorder logic
  - RMA/returns endpoints
  - Quotation endpoints

---

## **3. Administrative & Audit Features**

These features support compliance, traceability, and system integrity. They should be implemented after the core models but before advanced UI.

- ‚¨úÔ∏è **Audit Trail (Phase 6)**
  - Backend audit logging for all critical actions
  - Frontend UI for viewing/filtering audit logs

---

## **4. User Interface & Workflow Features**

With the backend stable, focus on building and connecting the UI for all major workflows.

- ‚¨úÔ∏è **Inventory UI (Phase 1)**
  - Stock adjustment forms and history
  - Location/transfer UI
  - Stocktake worksheet and variance UI
  - Part management (categories, suppliers)
- ‚¨úÔ∏è **Order UI (Phase 2)**
  - Order status management
  - Pick list and shipment UI
  - Backorder and RMA flows
  - Quotation management UI
- ‚¨úÔ∏è **User Management UI (Phase 3)**
  - Admin user management screens
  - User profile/self-service screens

---

## **5. Reporting & Analytics**

These depend on the completeness of the data models and workflows.

- ‚¨úÔ∏è **Reporting (Phase 4)**
  - Inventory valuation
  - Stock aging
  - Sales reports
  - Low stock/reorder suggestions

---

## **6. User Experience & Workflow Enhancements**

These can be layered on as the core features stabilize.

- ‚¨úÔ∏è **Dashboard & KPIs (Phase 5)**
  - Expand dashboard widgets/cards
  - Add links to modules
- ‚¨úÔ∏è **Advanced Search & Filtering (Phase 5)**
  - Consistent search/filtering across lists
- ‚¨úÔ∏è **System Notifications (Phase 5)**
  - Backend notification events
  - In-app and email notifications
- ‚¨úÔ∏è **Mobile Responsiveness (Phase 5)**
  - Audit and improve for all key views

---

## **7. Technical Debt & Integration**

Ongoing, but should be prioritized after each major feature set is completed.

- ‚¨úÔ∏è **Error Handling & Validation**
- ‚¨úÔ∏è **API Usage Audit**
- ‚¨úÔ∏è **Remove Unused Code**
- ‚¨úÔ∏è **Automated Tests**
- ‚¨úÔ∏è **Documentation Updates**

## **Summary Table: Recommended Implementation Order**

| Priority | Area                                  | Why?                                      |
|----------|---------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| 1        | User Management & Permissions         | Foundation for all access & workflows      |
| 2        | Core Data Models & API Endpoints      | Stable backend for all features            |
| 3        | Audit Trail & Admin Features          | Compliance, traceability                   |
| 4        | UI for Inventory, Orders, Users       | Main user workflows                        |
| 5        | Reporting & Analytics                 | Depends on data completeness               |
| 6        | UX Enhancements (Dashboard, Search)   | Improves usability, can be iterative       |
| 7        | Technical Debt & Integration          | Ensures maintainability, ongoing           |

---

**Notes:**
- Always implement backend endpoints and data models before connecting or building the corresponding frontend UI.
- Prioritize features that unlock or unblock other features (e.g., permissions before workflow UIs).
- Review and refactor incrementally after each phase to minimize risk and technical debt.

---
**This prioritization should be reviewed with stakeholders and the development team regularly, adjusting as needed based on progress, feedback, and changing requirements.**
