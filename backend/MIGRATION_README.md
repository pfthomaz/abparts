# ABParts Data Migration Implementation

This document describes the comprehensive data migration implementation for the ABParts Business Model Alignment project.

## Overview

The migration system transforms existing ABParts data to align with the new business model schema, including:

- Organization type classification (Oraseas EE, BossAqua, Customer, Supplier)
- User role migration with proper business hierarchy
- Parts classification (consumable vs bulk material, proprietary vs general)
- Warehouse-based inventory management
- Transaction tracking system
- Comprehensive validation and rollback capabilities

## Migration Steps

The migration process includes these key steps:

### 1. Organization Type Migration
- Analyzes organization names to determine business types
- Sets proper organization types (oraseas_ee, bossaqua, customer, supplier)
- Establishes parent-child relationships for suppliers

### 2. User Role Migration
- Updates user roles to new system (user, admin, super_admin)
- Enforces business rule: super_admins must be in Oraseas EE
- Ensures each organization has at least one admin

### 3. Parts Classification Migration
- Classifies parts as consumable or bulk_material based on keywords
- Identifies proprietary parts (BossAqua) vs general parts
- Updates unit of measure for bulk materials (liters vs pieces)

### 4. Warehouse Management
- Ensures each organization has at least one warehouse
- Creates default warehouses where needed
- Migrates inventory to warehouse-based model

### 5. Inventory Migration
- Links inventory records to specific warehouses
- Maintains current stock levels and recommendations
- Preserves unit of measure consistency

### 6. Transaction Creation
- Creates initial transaction records for existing inventory
- Establishes audit trail for all parts movements
- Links transactions to users, warehouses, and parts

## Usage Instructions

### Development/Testing

```bash
# Test migration with current database
python backend/simple_migration_test.py

# Validate current database state
python backend/simple_validation_test.py

# Run comprehensive test suite
python backend/test_migration.py

# Dry run migration (safe testing)
python backend/migrate_data.py --dry-run
```

### Production Migration

```bash
# Create backup directory
mkdir -p /path/to/migration/backups

# Run dry-run first to test
python backend/production_migrate.py --backup-dir=/path/to/migration/backups --dry-run

# Run actual migration (requires confirmation)
python backend/production_migrate.py --backup-dir=/path/to/migration/backups

# If issues found, force migration (use with caution)
python backend/production_migrate.py --backup-dir=/path/to/migration/backups --force
```

### Rollback (if needed)

```bash
# Navigate to backup directory
cd /path/to/migration/backups/migration_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS

# Run rollback script
./rollback.sh
```

## Safety Features

### Pre-Migration Safety
- Database dump creation before any changes
- Pre-migration validation to identify issues
- Dry-run mode for safe testing
- User confirmation required for production migration

### During Migration
- Transaction-based operations with rollback on failure
- Progress tracking and detailed logging
- Error handling with graceful degradation
- Backup of original data before transformation

### Post-Migration Safety
- Comprehensive validation of migrated data
- Business rule compliance checking
- Automatic rollback script generation
- Detailed migration reports and audit trails

## Validation Checks

The system performs extensive validation:

### Organization Validation
- Exactly one Oraseas EE organization
- At most one BossAqua organization
- All suppliers have parent organizations
- Reasonable organization hierarchy depth

### User Validation
- Super admins only in Oraseas EE organization
- Each organization has at least one admin
- Valid user status values
- Proper role assignments

### Data Integrity
- All inventory linked to valid warehouses
- All warehouses linked to valid organizations
- No negative inventory quantities
- Consistent units of measure

### Business Rules
- Machines belong to customer organizations only
- Unique machine serial numbers
- Valid transaction references
- Proper transaction warehouse logic

## Error Handling

The migration system includes comprehensive error handling:

- **Validation Errors**: Pre-migration checks prevent invalid states
- **Migration Errors**: Individual step failures with detailed logging
- **Rollback Capability**: Automatic restoration from backups
- **Progress Tracking**: Detailed statistics and error reporting
- **Graceful Degradation**: Continues processing despite individual record failures

## Performance Considerations

The migration is designed for the ABParts scale requirements:
- Maximum 100 customer organizations
- Maximum 200 total users
- Maximum 200 different parts
- Maximum 150 warehouses
- Maximum 7,500 transactions per year

Performance optimizations include:
- Batch processing of records
- Efficient SQL queries using raw SQL where needed
- Progress tracking to monitor performance
- Memory-efficient data processing

## Monitoring and Reporting

Each migration run produces:
- Detailed progress logs with timestamps
- Statistics for each migration step
- Error and warning summaries
- Pre and post-migration validation reports
- Complete audit trail in JSON format

## Testing Results

The migration system has been tested with:
- ✅ Empty database scenarios
- ✅ Existing production-like data
- ✅ Edge cases and error conditions
- ✅ Rollback and recovery procedures
- ✅ Performance with expected data volumes

## Conclusion

This migration implementation provides a robust, safe, and comprehensive solution for migrating ABParts data to the new business model schema. It includes all required features:

- ✅ Migration scripts for existing data transformation
- ✅ Data validation and integrity checking
- ✅ Rollback capabilities for migration failures
- ✅ Migration progress tracking and reporting
- ✅ Testing with production data samples

The system is production-ready and includes extensive safety measures to ensure data integrity throughout the migration process.
