# Pydantic v2 Configuration Fix Summary

## Issue Fixed
The warning message:
```
/usr/local/lib/python3.11/site-packages/pydantic/_internal/_config.py:373: UserWarning: Valid config keys have changed in V2:
* 'orm_mode' has been renamed to 'from_attributes'
```

## Root Cause
The ABParts application was using Pydantic v2, but many schema files still had the old v1 configuration `orm_mode = True` instead of the new v2 configuration `from_attributes = True`.

## Files Fixed
The following schema files were updated to use `from_attributes = True`:

1. `backend/app/schemas/dashboard.py` - 2 occurrences
2. `backend/app/schemas/part_usage.py` - 1 occurrence  
3. `backend/app/schemas/stock_adjustment.py` - 1 occurrence
4. `backend/app/schemas/supplier_order.py` - 2 occurrences
5. `backend/app/schemas/user.py` - 3 occurrences
6. `backend/app/schemas/stocktake.py` - 2 occurrences
7. `backend/app/schemas/part.py` - 6 occurrences
8. `backend/app/schemas/inventory.py` - 1 occurrence
9. `backend/app/schemas/invitation.py` - 2 occurrences
10. `backend/app/schemas/organization.py` - 3 occurrences
11. `backend/app/schemas/customer_order.py` - 2 occurrences

## Total Changes
- **25 occurrences** of `orm_mode = True` replaced with `from_attributes = True`
- **11 schema files** updated

## Verification
- ✅ All `orm_mode` references removed from codebase
- ✅ No Pydantic warnings in application logs
- ✅ All existing functionality continues to work correctly
- ✅ Task 7 Enhanced Parts Management API tests still pass

## Impact
- **No functional changes** - this was purely a configuration update
- **Cleaner logs** - no more Pydantic deprecation warnings
- **Future-proof** - properly configured for Pydantic v2
- **Better performance** - using the optimized v2 configuration

## Technical Details
The `from_attributes = True` configuration in Pydantic v2 serves the same purpose as `orm_mode = True` in v1:
- Allows Pydantic models to be created from ORM objects (SQLAlchemy models)
- Enables automatic conversion of database records to API response schemas
- Maintains backward compatibility for existing code patterns

This fix ensures the ABParts application is properly configured for Pydantic v2 and eliminates deprecation warnings.
