# backend/app/routers/__init__.py

# This file can be empty or contain package-level definitions.
# We are no longer explicitly importing sub-routers here, as main.py
# imports them directly (e.g., from .routers import organizations, users, parts).
# Removing explicit imports here avoids potential circular dependency issues.
