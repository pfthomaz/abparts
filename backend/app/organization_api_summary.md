# Organization Type Management API - Implementation Summary

## Overview

This document summarizes the comprehensive implementation of **Task 2.2: Organization Type Management API** which provides enhanced organization management capabilities with support for organization types, hierarchy, and business rule validation.

## API Endpoints Implemented

### 1. Core Organization CRUD

#### GET `/organizations/`
- **Purpose**: Get all organizations with optional filtering
- **Query Parameters**:
  - `organization_type`: Filter by organization type (oraseas_ee, bossaqua, customer, supplier)
  - `include_inactive`: Include inactive organizations (default: false)
- **Response**: List of OrganizationResponse
- **Business Logic**: Supports type filtering and active/inactive filtering

#### GET `/organizations/{org_id}`
- **Purpose**: Get a single organization by ID
- **Response**: OrganizationResponse with parent and children relationships
- **Security**: Role-based access control (super_admin or own organization)

#### POST `/organizations/`
- **Purpose**: Create a new organization with business rule validation
- **Request**: OrganizationCreate schema
- **Response**: OrganizationResponse
- **Security**: super_admin only
- **Business Rules**:
  - Supplier organizations must have a parent
  - Only one Oraseas EE organization allowed
  - Only one BossAqua organization allowed
  - Parent organization must exist and be active

#### PUT `/organizations/{org_id}`
- **Purpose**: Update an existing organization
- **Request**: OrganizationUpdate schema
- **Response**: OrganizationResponse
- **Security**: super_admin or admin of own organization
- **Business Rules**:
  - Validates hierarchy constraints
  - Prevents circular references
  - Enforces singleton constraints

#### DELETE `/organizations/{org_id}`
- **Purpose**: Delete (soft delete) an organization
- **Response**: 204 No Content
- **Security**: super_admin only
- **Business Rules**:
  - Cannot delete organizations with active children
  - Soft delete if dependencies exist
  - Hard delete if no dependencies

### 2. Organization Type Management

#### GET `/organizations/types`
- **Purpose**: Get organizations grouped by type
- **Query Parameters**:
  - `include_inactive`: Include inactive organizations
- **Response**: List of OrganizationTypeFilterResponse
- **Features**: Shows count and organizations for each type

### 3. Organization Hierarchy Management

#### GET `/organizations/hierarchy/roots`
- **Purpose**: Get root-level organizations (no parent)
- **Query Parameters**:
  - `include_inactive`: Include inactive organizations
- **Response**: List of OrganizationResponse
- **Use Case**: Building organization tree views

#### GET `/organizations/{org_id}/hierarchy`
- **Purpose**: Get complete hierarchy starting from an organization
- **Response**: OrganizationHierarchyResponse with nested children
- **Security**: super_admin or own organization
- **Features**: Prevents infinite loops, includes depth information

#### GET `/organizations/{org_id}/children`
- **Purpose**: Get direct children of an organization
- **Query Parameters**:
  - `include_inactive`: Include inactive organizations
- **Response**: List of OrganizationResponse
- **Security**: super_admin or own organization

### 4. Organization Search and Filtering

#### GET `/organizations/search`
- **Purpose**: Search organizations by name with optional type filtering
- **Query Parameters**:
  - `q`: Search query (required, min length 1)
  - `organization_type`: Filter by organization type
  - `include_inactive`: Include inactive organizations
- **Response**: List of OrganizationResponse
- **Features**: Case-insensitive search, type filtering

### 5. Supplier-Parent Relationship Management

#### POST `/organizations/{org_id}/suppliers`
- **Purpose**: Create a supplier organization under a parent
- **Request**: OrganizationCreate schema (type forced to supplier)
- **Response**: OrganizationResponse
- **Security**: super_admin or admin of parent organization
- **Business Logic**: Automatically sets parent relationship and supplier type

## Schema Updates

### 1. Enhanced Organization Schemas

```python
class OrganizationTypeEnum(str, Enum):
    ORASEAS_EE = "oraseas_ee"
    BOSSAQUA = "bossaqua"
    CUSTOMER = "customer"
    SUPPLIER = "supplier"

class OrganizationBase(BaseModel):
    name: str
    organization_type: OrganizationTypeEnum
    parent_organization_id: Optional[uuid.UUID] = None
    address: Optional[str] = None
    contact_info: Optional[str] = None
    is_active: bool = True

class OrganizationResponse(OrganizationBase, BaseSchema):
    parent_organization: Optional['OrganizationResponse'] = None
    child_organizations: List['OrganizationResponse'] = []
```

### 2. New Response Schemas

- **OrganizationHierarchyResponse**: For hierarchy queries with nested children
- **OrganizationTypeFilterResponse**: For type-grouped organization lists

## CRUD Operations Enhanced

### 1. Business Rule Validation

- **Singleton Constraints**: Only one Oraseas EE and BossAqua organization
- **Hierarchy Validation**: Suppliers must have parents, no circular references
- **Dependency Checking**: Prevents deletion of organizations with dependencies

### 2. Advanced Query Operations

- **Type Filtering**: Get organizations by specific type
- **Hierarchy Queries**: Build complete organization trees
- **Search Functionality**: Name-based search with type filtering
- **Active/Inactive Management**: Soft delete support

### 3. Performance Optimizations

- **Eager Loading**: Uses joinedload for parent/child relationships
- **Efficient Queries**: Optimized database queries for hierarchy operations
- **Cycle Prevention**: Algorithms to prevent circular references

## Security Implementation

### 1. Role-Based Access Control

- **super_admin**: Full access to all organizations
- **admin**: Access to own organization and children
- **user**: Read-only access to own organization

### 2. Permission Validation

- **Organization Ownership**: Users can only access their own organization data
- **Hierarchy Permissions**: Access to children based on parent ownership
- **Creation Restrictions**: Only super_admin can create root organizations

## Business Rules Enforced

### 1. Organization Type Rules

- **Oraseas EE**: Only one allowed, root level organization
- **BossAqua**: Only one allowed, can be root or child
- **Customer**: Multiple allowed, typically root level
- **Supplier**: Multiple allowed, must have parent organization

### 2. Hierarchy Rules

- **Parent Validation**: Parent must exist and be active
- **Circular Reference Prevention**: Cannot create cycles in hierarchy
- **Deletion Constraints**: Cannot delete organizations with active children

### 3. Data Integrity Rules

- **Active Status**: Inactive organizations cannot be parents
- **Dependency Management**: Soft delete when dependencies exist
- **Relationship Consistency**: Parent-child relationships maintained

## Error Handling

### 1. Validation Errors (400)

- Business rule violations
- Invalid hierarchy operations
- Missing required relationships
- Circular reference attempts

### 2. Authorization Errors (403)

- Insufficient permissions
- Access to unauthorized organizations
- Role-based restrictions

### 3. Not Found Errors (404)

- Organization not found
- Parent organization not found
- Invalid organization IDs

## Integration Points

### 1. Authentication System

- Integrates with existing JWT token system
- Uses role-based decorators for endpoint protection
- Supports organization context in tokens

### 2. Database Layer

- Uses SQLAlchemy ORM with proper relationships
- Supports database constraints and triggers
- Optimized queries for performance

### 3. API Documentation

- Comprehensive OpenAPI documentation
- Query parameter descriptions
- Response model definitions
- Error response documentation

## Testing Considerations

### 1. Unit Tests Needed

- CRUD operation validation
- Business rule enforcement
- Hierarchy operation correctness
- Permission checking logic

### 2. Integration Tests Needed

- End-to-end API workflows
- Database constraint validation
- Authentication integration
- Error handling scenarios

### 3. Performance Tests Needed

- Hierarchy query performance
- Large dataset handling
- Concurrent operation safety

## Next Steps

1. **Run Database Migration**: Apply the schema changes
2. **Update Authentication**: Ensure role enums match new UserRole
3. **Create Unit Tests**: Comprehensive test coverage
4. **Update Frontend**: Modify UI to use new API endpoints
5. **Documentation**: Update API documentation
