# ABParts Inventory Management System Overview

## Two Complementary Inventory Management Areas

### 1. Warehouse Inventory Management (`/inventory`)
**Purpose:** Day-to-day inventory operations and management

**Features:**
- **Current Inventory View** - Real-time stock levels for all parts
- **Transfer Inventory** - Move stock between warehouses
- **Adjust Stock** - Manual stock adjustments with reasons
- **Add Inventory Item** - Add new inventory records
- **Transfer History** - Track all inventory movements
- **Stock Adjustments** - History of all manual adjustments
- **Analytics** - Inventory analytics and reporting

**Use Cases:**
- Daily inventory operations
- Receiving new stock
- Transferring parts between locations
- Manual corrections for damaged/lost items
- Monitoring stock levels and trends

### 2. Stocktake Management (`/stocktake`)
**Purpose:** Formal inventory auditing and cycle counting

**Features:**
- **Plan Stocktakes** - Schedule formal inventory counts
- **Execute Counts** - Systematic counting of all items in a warehouse
- **Track Discrepancies** - Compare expected vs actual quantities
- **Generate Adjustments** - Automatically create adjustments based on count results
- **Audit Trail** - Complete record of who counted what and when
- **Status Tracking** - planned → in_progress → completed workflow

**Use Cases:**
- Periodic inventory audits
- Cycle counting programs
- Compliance requirements
- Identifying systematic inventory issues
- End-of-period inventory verification

## How They Work Together

### Data Flow:
1. **Normal Operations** → Warehouse Inventory Management updates stock levels
2. **Periodic Audits** → Stocktake Management verifies accuracy
3. **Discrepancies Found** → Stocktake generates adjustments
4. **Adjustments Applied** → Updates reflected in Warehouse Inventory Management

### Database Integration:
- Both systems use the same `inventory` table for current stock levels
- Stocktake system has dedicated tables: `stocktakes`, `stocktake_items`
- Stock adjustments from stocktakes are recorded in `stock_adjustments` table
- All changes maintain audit trails with user tracking

### Permission Levels:
- **Regular Users** - Can view inventory, perform basic operations
- **Admin Users** - Can create stocktakes, make adjustments
- **Super Admin** - Full access to all inventory operations across organizations

## Production Deployment Considerations

### Database Tables Required:
```sql
-- Core inventory (already exists)
inventory

-- Stocktake system (created by migration)
stocktakes
stocktake_items
inventory_alerts
inventory_adjustments

-- Supporting tables (already exist)
warehouses
parts
users
organizations
```

### Migration Impact:
- ✅ **No disruption** to existing Warehouse Inventory Management
- ✅ **Adds new functionality** via Stocktake Management
- ✅ **Maintains data integrity** between both systems
- ✅ **Preserves existing** inventory records and history

### Post-Deployment Workflow:
1. **Continue using** Warehouse Inventory Management for daily operations
2. **Start using** Stocktake Management for formal inventory counts
3. **Reconcile differences** found during stocktakes
4. **Maintain accuracy** through regular cycle counting

## Best Practices

### When to Use Warehouse Inventory Management:
- Daily receiving and shipping operations
- Inter-warehouse transfers
- Quick stock level checks
- Immediate corrections for known issues
- Inventory analytics and reporting

### When to Use Stocktake Management:
- Monthly/quarterly inventory audits
- Cycle counting programs
- Investigating inventory discrepancies
- Compliance audits
- Year-end inventory verification

### Integration Points:
- Stocktake results can generate stock adjustments
- Stock adjustments appear in both systems
- Inventory levels are synchronized in real-time
- User permissions control access to both areas
- Audit trails track all changes across both systems
