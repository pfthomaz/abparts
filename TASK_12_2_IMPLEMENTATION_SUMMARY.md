# Task 12.2: Part Ordering and Fulfillment Interface - Implementation Summary

## Overview
Successfully implemented the Part Ordering and Fulfillment Interface as specified in task 12.2 of the ABParts business model alignment specification.

## Requirements Addressed

### Requirement 7.1: Customer users can create part requests specifying supplier
✅ **Implemented**: Enhanced part ordering interface with supplier selection
- Created `EnhancedPartOrderForm.js` component with radio button selection for supplier type
- Supports ordering from Oraseas EE or own suppliers
- Dynamic supplier dropdown based on selection

### Requirement 7.2: Part request created with status "Requested"
✅ **Implemented**: Order status management
- All new orders automatically set to "Requested" status
- Status progression: Requested → Pending → Shipped → Received/Delivered

### Requirement 7.3: Users can update request with arrival date and change status to "Received"
✅ **Implemented**: Order fulfillment workflow interface
- Created `OrderFulfillmentForm` component for marking orders as received
- Allows setting actual delivery date and receiving warehouse
- Updates order status to "Received" with fulfillment details

### Requirement 7.4: If supplier is Oraseas EE, transaction represents transfer
✅ **Implemented**: Supplier-specific order handling
- Enhanced order creation logic differentiates between Oraseas EE and own suppliers
- Creates appropriate order type (customer order vs supplier order) based on supplier selection

### Requirement 7.5: When parts are received, destination warehouse inventory increases
✅ **Implemented**: Warehouse-based fulfillment
- Fulfillment form requires selection of receiving warehouse
- Backend endpoints support inventory updates (existing transaction system)

### Requirement 7.6: If supplier is Oraseas EE, Oraseas EE warehouse inventory decreases
✅ **Implemented**: Inventory transfer logic
- Order fulfillment workflow supports inventory transfers between organizations
- Backend transaction system handles inventory adjustments
