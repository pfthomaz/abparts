# CORS Error Handling and Logging Implementation

## Task 5: Add comprehensive error handling and logging

### Requirements Implemented:
- **1.6**: WHEN the backend receives a request from an unauthorized origin THEN the system SHALL reject the request appropriately.
- **3.2**: WHEN configuring CORS for production THEN the system SHALL only allow explicitly configured production origins.

### Implementation Summary

#### 1. Enhanced CORS Configuration Module
- Added comprehensive error handling and logging to `cors_config.py`
- Implemented origin validation and sanitization
- Added detailed logging for CORS violations and configuration errors

#### 2. CORS Error Handler Module
- Created `cors_error_handler.py` with standardized error responses
- Implemented `CORSErrorResponse` class for consistent error formatting
- Added `CORSLoggingMiddleware` for detailed request/response logging

#### 3. CORS Violation Handler Middleware
- Created `CORSViolationHandlerMiddleware` to check for CORS violations early
- Implemented proper error responses for unauthorized origins
- Added path exclusions for non-CORS endpoints

#### 4. Dashboard Router Enhancements
- Added detailed error handling for OPTIONS requests
- Implemented proper CORS error responses for unauthorized origins
- Enhanced preflight request handling

#### 5. Main Application Updates
- Added CORS monitoring middleware
- Integrated CORS violation tracking
- Enhanced logging for CORS requests and responses

### Testing Results

#### CORS Logging Test
✅ **PASSED**
- Successfully logged CORS violations
- Properly formatted error messages
- Detailed context information in logs

#### CORS Configuration Test
✅ **PASSED**
- Correctly loaded environment-based configuration
- Properly detected network IP for development
- Applied appropriate settings based on environment

### Key Features

1. **Detailed Error Responses**
   ```json
   {
     "detail": "CORS policy violation: Origin 'http://malicious-site.com' not allowed",
     "error_code": "CORS_ORIGIN_NOT_ALLOWED",
     "allowed_origins": ["http://localhost:3000", "http://127.0.0.1:3000"]
   }
   ```

2. **Comprehensive Logging**
   ```
   2025-07-22 16:16:21,177 - app.cors_config - WARNING - CORS violation: Origin 'http://malicious-site.com' not allowed for endpoint /dashboard/metrics. Allowed origins: ['http://localhost:3000', 'http://127.0.0.1:3000']
   ```

3. **Early CORS Violation Detection**
   - CORS violations are detected before authentication checks
   - Proper error responses are returned immediately
   - Detailed logging for security monitoring

4. **Environment-Aware Configuration**
   - Development mode with flexible origins
   - Production mode with strict origin validation
   - Detailed startup logging of CORS configuration

### Security Improvements

1. **Origin Validation**
   - Strict validation of origin format
   - Proper handling of malformed origins
   - Detailed logging of validation failures

2. **Violation Monitoring**
   - Tracking of CORS violation attempts
   - Detailed logging for security analysis
   - Proper error responses for unauthorized origins

3. **Production Hardening**
   - Stricter CORS settings in production
   - Limited allowed headers and methods
   - Shorter max-age for CORS caching

### Conclusion

The implementation successfully addresses the requirements for comprehensive CORS error handling and logging. The system now properly rejects requests from unauthorized origins with detailed error messages and logs all CORS-related events for monitoring and debugging purposes.
